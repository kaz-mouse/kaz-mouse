Project Manager with strong focus matching technology to meet business needs in the right way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a results-driven Technical Program Manager, I turn complex IT initiatives into real business impact. With deep expertise in finance and manufacturing, I bridge the gap between technical teams and C-suite leaders—building trust, driving ROI, and leading multi-million dollar programs to success. My strategic leadership and hands-on development background ensure every initiative delivers measurable results.
